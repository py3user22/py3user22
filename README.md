My new schedule is about 6-8+ hours daily on my programming studies, and certifications.  I am averaging about 6 hours daily minimum, 9 is sometimes max for a day.  My daily time starts at 2300 - 2300.  I am practicing at the moment Javascript, & HTML/CSS, and have restarted my python3 training.  My new skill I am proud of is the making of dynamic webpages, and every document I make is now registered on my local machine as a website, that has all my programming files for really easy access & viewing.  I am focused on my training, but would like eventually to start working in IT security, or now full-stack developer, or front/back developer.  Cheers!

I have been practicing & documenting my hours for about 2 years now, practicing my python3 daily, I average about 150 hours each month, which is 3 hours a day, sometimes slightly less, sometimes 2x more.  I usually dont miss a day unless family comes to visit & I am outside with them all day.  Just a habit now, I love to learn & experience new things.  Always into gaining more knowledge and skills that can benefit me in my daily life & work.  I have two gifted daughters & I show them that hardwork & willingness to learn new things is good for them.
